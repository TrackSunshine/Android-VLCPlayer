u don't want kids jumping about expressing themselves

280
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:47,287
 有点危险
A bit dangerous.

281
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,359
是 你都是在周五跳舞
Yeah, you do all that on Friday,

282
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,201
然后他们就在家过周末 不出门
but then they spend the weekend indoors,

283
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,648
黏在游戏机上
glued to their Nintendo DS.

284
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:55,012
真是这么回事 两周前 我周一到教室
Totally. A couple of weeks ago I came in Monday

285
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:57,435
我跟波比说 让孩子坐下开始交流时间
I told Poppy sat the kids down for carpet time,

286
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,318
问问他们周末都干什么了
asked them what they did over the weekend.

287
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,057
多好的天气啊 竟然没有一个人出去过
Gorgeous weather. Not one of them had been out.

288
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:04,143
他们全都呆在家里打游戏
They'd all been sitting at home on their PlayStations.

289
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,020
他们坐地毯上 你怎么都弄不起来
You couldn't get them up off the carpet.

290
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,766
等他们起来了 一个个都气喘吁吁
When they got up, they were wheezing.

291
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:10,757
真是污染你啊      我们以前都去公园的
That's pollution for u        We always used to go to park

292
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,501
很多孩子都没有公园可去      恩 很对
A lot of them don't have parks to go to.        Ye, exactly

293
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:15,671
但是散步的话也不需要去公园啊
But you don't need a park to go for a walk.

294
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,768
如果爸爸妈妈都不出去 孩子也不会
If Mum and Dad don't go out, the kids don't.

295
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,070
家长们都不敢让孩子们出去玩
Parents are too frightened to let their kids play out.

296
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,639
就算是附近有绿地 也不让他们在那玩
Even a bit of green by estate they don't let them play there.

297
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,770
但对很多父母来说 的确是够艰难的 不是吗
But it's hard for a lot of mums and dads, isn't it?

298
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,598
在强大工作压力下拼命做一个星期
They've had a hell of a week.under pressure and stress.

299
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,727
说的是啊      下班回来还要在家里工作
Tell me about it.    They get back from work if they work...

300
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,708
你知道的 当中很多都是单亲妈妈 她们累坏了
u know.A lot of them're single mums they're exhausted.

301
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,639
如果她们没有带孩子们去野餐也是可以理解的
It's understandable if they don't take their kids out for a lovely picnic.

302
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,896
我不能接受
It's not acceptable.

303
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:39,819
生活是艰辛
Life's hard,

304
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,460
但如果真的想办法 还是会想到的 不是么
but if u want to find a way you find it, innit?

305
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,515
有些父母不想被烦      是啊 我知道
Some parents can't be bothered.         Yeah, I know.

306
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,438
所以他们宁愿让孩子在聊天室待到大半夜
So they let their kids stay up half night on chat rooms

307
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,596
 是啊      是啊 真让人担心
 Yeah!        Yeah, that's worrying.

308
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,234
恐怖      真让人生气
Scary.        Makes me so angry.

309
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,401
很多7岁的孩子 对于网络知道的比我们还多
A lot 7-year-olds know more about internet than we do

310
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,713
至少人们已经在关注这个事情了 还是不错的
At least people are talking about it. That's good.

311
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:59,144
是吗      是啊 这说明我们已经意识到了
Is it?        yeah. It means we're aware.

312
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,834
我知道吸烟对我不好 但不代表我要戒了
I'm aware smoking's bad for me It doesn't mean I'll stop

313
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,000
只要你知道什么能害死你就行      谢谢
As long as you know what will kill you.        Thanks

314
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,069
不客气
Any time.

315
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,917
我知道喝酒对我不好 但你知道
I know drinking's bad for me, but, you know...

316
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,339
我控制不住
I can't help myself.

317
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:09,934
哦 丢人      干杯!
Oh, shame.        Cheers!

318
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,867
干杯 朋友们
Cheers, everyone!

319
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,108
为我们的肝 以及溺死在里面的一切
Here's to our livers and all who drown in them.

320
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,054
小心点 波比 明天是你第一节驾驶课
Careful, Poppy u got ur first driving lesson tomorrow.

321
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,168
哦 对哦 快点 快放下来
Oh, yeah, quick, put that down.

322
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,304
别把你的盲区搞砸了
You don't want to mess up your blind spot.

323
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:25,192
听起来不错      看这 有几根手指?
that sounds good.        it's here.How many fingers?

324
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,268
肯定是找你的      我太兴奋了
That must be for you.        I'm so excited!

325
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,880
你应该在进车之前做几个深呼吸
u should do some deep breathing before u get in the car.

326
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,043
看不到他 祝我好运吧
can't see him. Wish me luck.

327
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,189
好运 我会叫紧急救护人员准备好的
Good luck I'll keep the emergency services on standby

328
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,074
还有什么借口?      我知道你喜欢消防员
Any excuse, eh?        I know what u're like with firemen

329
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,393
你好 是斯科特吗
Hello. Scott?

330
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,956
你是波比?      是我 很高兴见到你

是的 车在这儿
Right, the car's just here.

332
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,990
没有传染病的 你怎么了?
They're not infected! What are you like?

333
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,493
手是干净的 其实我刚刚还特意洗了洗
They're clean, I just washed them specially,honest.

334
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,671
这就是练习车?      你坐乘客的位置
This it?        You get in the passenger seat.

335
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,371
你知道是我要学开车吗
You know it's me learning to drive?

336
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:09,169
知道 但有几件事情得先讲清楚
Yeah But we have to talk a few things through.

337
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,333
是吗 有道理 如果你坚持的话
have we? Fair enough. If you insist.

338
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,093
你选的这辆彩色的车?      不要拘束
Did u choose this colour car? Make urself comfortable.

339
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:20,361
谢谢 这是你的车吗?      不 是公司的车
Thank u Is this ur car?        No, it's the company's car

340
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,669
对哦 那你的车是什么样子的?      这就是我的车
right,what's ur car like, then?        It is my car

341
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,995
你说这是公司的车呀 你可想准了啊
u said it was the company's car Make your mind up.

342
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,474
你有临时驾照那?      有的
Have u got your provisional licence?        Yep!

343
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,232
给你 我那天状态不怎么好
There you go. That's me on a bad day.

344
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,111
这是你的真名吗 波琳?      对
Is that your real name, Pauline?        Right.

345
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,558
好 看起来一切正常      是吗 那太好了
OK,everything seems to be in order.        Does it? That's good.

346
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,656
你以前上过驾驶课吗
have u ever had a driving lesson before?

347
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,883
上过 也不算是真正的驾驶课
Yeah.No,it wasn't really a lesson.

348
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,521
在迈阿密开一辆凯迪拉克
It was in a Cadillac in Miami.

349
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,640
在沙滩上横冲直撞
Bunny-hopped down the beach.

350
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,427
我喝醉了 很好玩
I was a bit pissed, it was hilarious.

351
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,766
我们开这辆车时 不能喝酒 明白吗
We won't be pissed when driving this car, OK?

352
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,567
也不会横冲直撞 我们要集中 专注
We're not going to bunny-hop We'll focus concentrate.

353
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:54,371
我带你去场地 学员都在那学
I'm going to take u to a spot we take all learner drivers.

354
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:56,749
真的吗      我们要通过驾驶室训练
Are you?        We'll go through the cockpit drill

355
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:59,978
可真调皮      好好听讲 负责一点
naughty.        You'll listen and take responsibility.

356
00:24:00,078 --> 00:24:01,137
我会努力的
I'll see what I can do.

357
00:24:01,137 --> 00:24:04,145
好 系好安全带      马上 斯科特船长
OK.Put ur seat belt on.        Will do, Captain Scott.

358
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,373
出发啦 小男人
Here we go, gigolo.

359
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,793
你给办公室打过电话吗     是啊 跟你老板通过电话
So u spoke to the office?        Yeah I spoke to ur boss.

360
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,675
他不是我老板 我给自己打工
He's not my boss, I work for myself. I'm my own man.

361
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:19,868
但这是他的车...或者 你的车... 还是某人的
But it's his car... or it's your car... Someone.

362
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,595
他们告诉你价钱了吗 一个小时两块五
And they told you the price ?2.50 an hour?

363
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,358
是啊 跟薯条一样便宜 你真行
That's right. Cheap as chips, you lot.

364
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,436
我们价钱低 但是我们更出色      是吗
We may be cheap but we're better.        Are you?

365
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,472
你选大公司 可他们用的是没经验的教官
u go with big companies,they use inexperienced instructors

366
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,669
没经验?
They don't?

367
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,551
他们只是通过了一些考试 就多收钱
They've just passed their test and charge more.

368
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,271
混蛋
Bastards.

369
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,233
我们这些有经验的教官 我们去小公司 收钱少
Us experienced instructors,go with small companies charge less

370
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,352
这样更合理      价钱低是相对的
That makes a lot of sense that does.     Cheapness is relative

371
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,985
的确 你说的对 一语中的!
Yeah, it is. You're right. Bang-on!

372
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,053
那么 下周还是同一时间吗
So, do you want the same time every week?

373
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,835
到时候继续
Go on, then.

374
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,425
是或不是? 我得知道      如果你需要知道的话
Do u or don't u? I need to know.        if u need to know.

375
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,154
你没问题 那我就没问题 斯科特
If it's good for you, it's good for me, Scott.

376
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,679
好吧 就每周六12点
OK, 12 o'clock every Saturday.

377
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,392
你喜欢周六上班吗      我周六就工作半天
Do u like working Saturdays?        I only work half day,Saturday.

378
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:06,470
真好      你是我最后一个学生
that's good.        You're my last pupil.

379
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,306
那你剩下的时间干吗呢
What do u do for rest of day?

380
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:12,583
你今晚出去玩吗
Are u going out tonight?

381
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,876
我会回家 看书
I shall go home and read my book.

382
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,284
肯定是本好书 什么名字
it must be a good book. What is it?

383
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,206
就是一本书
It's a book.

384
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,132
这样啊 好吧 至少我们知道了一些事情
Yeah, well, we worked that much out.

385
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,434
你看到你前面这三个踏板了吧      恩 看到了
u see three pedals in front of you.        Yeah, yeah.

386
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,790
把左脚踩在左边的踏板上 然后一路踩下去
Will u put left foot on left-hand pedal push it all the way down?

387
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,432
他还挺活泼的 是吧
He's a bit frisky, isn't he?

388
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,734
好的 波琳 把脚从踏板上拿开吧
OK, Pauline. Please take ur boot off the pedal.

389
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:42,545
从我两岁开始就没人叫我波琳了
Nobody's called me Pauline since I was 2 years old.

390
00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:43,749
让我觉得好笑
Makes me laugh.

391
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,066
那我应该叫你什么
What am I supposed to call you?

392
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:46,951
哦 波比怎么样      波比?
Oh, how about Poppy?        Poppy?

393
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,399
对      哦 好吧
Yeah.        Oh, yeah.

394
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,503
不 随便叫什么 斯科特 我不介意的
No,whatever turns u on, Scott. I don't mind.

395
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,420
好的 波比 你的靴子不太适合上驾驶课
OK,Poppy.ur boots're inappropriate for a driving lesson

396
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,169
我的鞋怎么了      穿高跟鞋控制不好车
What's wrong with them?u can't control a car in high heels.

397
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,742
我穿高跟鞋可以做很多事
I can do a lot in these.

398
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:00,593
你应该看看我学跳舞的时候
u should see me in these on a dance floor.

399
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,914
高跟鞋可能很适合舞蹈课
They may be good on a dance floor

400
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:03,562
不止适合舞蹈课
Not just good on a dance floor.

401
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:04,556
他们很棒!
They are "Oooh".

402
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,425
可能适合你坐在沙滩上的凯迪拉克里
They may be good in a Cadillac on a beach

403
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:07,805
当你跟男朋友喝得酩酊大醉的时候
when you're pissed with your boyfriend,

404
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:09,652
但驾驶课就不适合
but they're not suitable for driving.

405
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,729
你很风趣
You're funny.

406
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,363
我希望你下周能穿平底鞋来
Now, next week I want u to bring flat-soled shoes.

407
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:15,296
我穿平底鞋不怎么好看      不管你好不好看
I don't look any good in them.        It's not how u look,

408
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:16,228
你是要学怎么开车
 it's how you drive.

409
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,074
我看能不能为你搞到一双了 斯科特 我来解决
I'll see what I can rustle up for u,Scott.Leave it to me.

410
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,439
好了 你看到三面镜子
Right, you see three mirrors

411
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,869
两面侧视静 一面后视镜
ur two side-view mirrors and your rear-view mirror.

412
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,377
他们组成了一个黄金三角形
They make a golden triangle.

413
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:25,627
就像阴部三角区一样吗?
Is that like the pubic triangle?

414
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,541
就像是一个金字塔 在顶端
It's a pyramid and at the top of it

415
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,732
有只可以洞穿一切的眼睛 "因哈拉"
u see the all-seeing eye Enrahah.

416
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:32,286
你可以重复一下吗 "因-拉-哈"
Can you repeat that, please? "En-ra-hah".

417
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,430
你是说路西法之眼吗      不是
You talking about the eye of Lucifer?        No!

418
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,755
因为我不知道能否把注意力集中到那 谢谢
Cos I don't know if I want to look in there, thank you.

419
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,553
不是路西法 在路西法之前还有两个堕落天使
It's not Lucifer.There are two fallen angels before Lucifer.

420
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,278
有因拉哈 拉结尔 然后才是 路西法
There is Enrahah Raziel and Lucifer.

421
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:43,590
我没他们的电话号码
I don't have them in my phone book.

422
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,917
耐心听我说      他在哪
Bear with me.        Where is he?

423
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:46,119
听我说      我看不到他
Bear with me.        I can't see him.

424
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,593
只是个教学工具而已      是吗
It's a teaching tool.        Is it?

425
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,756
我先给你解释下一些关于教学的事情
Let me explain something to you about teaching.

426
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,578
老师的工作就是帮助学生养成好习惯
teacher's job is to bring out good habits in the pupil

427
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,644
改掉坏习惯
and to get rid of bad habits.

428
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,200
都是通过向学生重复这些思想做到的
He does that through frequent repetitive thinking.

429
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,629
他用清晰明了的画面来反应这些思想
he does that by creating clear and distinct images

430
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,641
学生就很容易接受并且记住不忘
that are easy for the pupil to retain.

431
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:02,670
哦 现在也是吗      是啊
Oh, does he, now?        Yes.

432
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,058
别担心 已经烙在这里了
Don't worry, it's burnt in there.

433
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,033
你记住 你一直到死都会记得因拉哈
u remember.u will remember Enrahah till the day u die

434
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,399
那我就功德圆满了
and I will have done my job.

435
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,321
你为什么不说些好东西 比如大草莓什么的
Why don't u have sth nice up there like a giant strawberry?

436
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,952
你相信我 很管用
Believe you me, it works.

437
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,797
好了 住手      我现在干吗
OK, stop!        What am I doing now?

438
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,274
请把你的手从排挡上拿开 从变速杆上拿开
Please take ur hand off the gear. Off the gear stick!

439
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,799
好吧      脚从踏板上拿开
All right.        Foot off the pedal.

440
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,559
我什么都不动了      我给你解释些事情
I'm not touching anything.        Let me explain to you sth

441
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,512
我就靠这辆车活了 这车是我的全部
This car is my livelihood.This car is how I earn my living.

442
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,634
我不知道你是干什么的      恩
I don't know how you earn your living.        Yeah.

443
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,518
但如果我走进你的酒吧 你的舞池 或者俱乐部
But if I walked into ur pub or ur discotheque or ur club

444
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,028
然后走向DJ 刮花他所有的碟片
and I walked up to the DJ I scratched all his records,

445
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,354
或者 我砸碎所有的杯子
or I smashed all the glasses,

446
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,624
然后我说 "对不起 我不知道我做了什么"
I said,"I'm sorry,I didn't know what I was doing"

447
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:38,274
你肯定不能接受
that wouldn't be acceptable.

448
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,102
那我有个问题
There is only one problem with that.

449
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,801
我没有酒吧 也没有舞厅
I don't own a bar or a disco.

450
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:44,291
我就是个小学老师
I'm just a primary school teacher.

451
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,928
你是小学老师?      恐怕是的 孩子
Are you?        Afraid so, kiddo.

452
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,677
你是撒旦崇拜者吗 斯科特
Are you a Satanist, Scott?

453
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,967
不是 刚好相反
No,in fact I'm exactly the opposite.

454
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:54,992
那你信教皇喽
Are you the Pope, then?

455
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,834
那是一回事      是吗 他知道吗
That's the same thing.        Is it? Does he know that?

456
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,300
好了 你有三个踏板 A B C
Right, you have three pedals, A, B, C.

457
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,213
油门 刹车 离合器
Accelerator, brake and clutch.

458
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:04,477

你会喜欢他的      会吗
You'd love him.        Would I?

462
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,036
他让我发笑 他很好玩
He made me laugh. He was funny.

463
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:14,036
什么样的 是哈哈大笑 还是怪怪的笑
What? Like funny "Ha ha" or funny peculiar?

464
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,601
实际上都有点吧      然后呢
Bit of both, actually.        So, what happened, then?

He shouted at me.        What? He gave u a telling off?

466
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,236
他那人有点拘谨 有那么点
He's a little bit uptight. Just a little bit.

467
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,874
肯定是你激他了      把你介绍给他吧
Bet you wound him up.        Might set you up with him.

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,724
他看上去健康吗      是的
Is he fit?        Yeah.

469
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,950
不 他看上去一点也不健康 不过就是适合你
No, he's not fit at all. Just your type.

470
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,753

举起手肘 好像有线提着一样
